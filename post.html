          I love wandering through the streets of Chandigarh, finding new places popping up at every corner. The city is constantly reinventing itself which was one of the reason I came back to my home city after many month. When asked about my experience, I can only respond:
        </p>
        <blockquote>Chandigarh is the first and only planned city of India: Modernity and tradition are fusing together and constantly give birth to new creations of light and shadow. It is true that the city never sleeps. The  lights are flickerung 24/7 and bathing the city in its glow and giving me life.</blockquote>
        <p>
          Now studying at <em>Chandigarh Group Of Colleges</em> I spents my days at the university, but the night is when I truly come alive. Walking through the city on the verge of light and shadow, I discover the most <strong>astonishing, ugly, beautiful places</strong>. Many people are questioning my love for Chandigarh perfections, but as it is the dream city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru"><q>Jawaharlal Nehru</q></a> , true beauty often lies beneath the surface.

          <p>
          I hope that more and more people will see the true beauty of Chandigarh soon. It is a captivating beast that you won't be able to take your eyes of again. Explore the city in your own pace and <u>discover things you have never seen before</u>.
